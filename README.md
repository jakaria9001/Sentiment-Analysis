# Sentiment-Analysis
This is my ongoing research repository of Sentiment Analysis.

As per Wikipedia definition, Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics,
and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

At the very initital moment we decided to select Twitter dataset as our primary dataset for implementing the BERT model, which
is the state-of-the-art model for sentiment analysis.
Steps involed in sentiment analysis: 
1. Collecting data ( web scrapping).
2. Preprocessing the text data (Tokenization).
3. Text Vectorization.
4. Sentiment analysis using various models.
